  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I’m Tom Werner, a Business Intelligence Analyst with 5+ years of experience building scalable analytics solutions,
  modernizing BI platforms, and enabling self-service reporting across cross-functional teams.
</p>

<p>
  At Flipp, I helped lead BI modernization following an acquisition, including migrating legacy dashboards and rebuilding
  high-trust reporting experiences with governed metrics and strong stakeholder alignment. I’m strongest in SQL, dashboarding,
  data modeling, and turning business questions into clear, decision-ready insights.
</p>

<p>
  I’m currently building a public portfolio using simulated and publicly available datasets to demonstrate my approach to
  analytics, including dashboard design, SQL analysis, and Python automation.
